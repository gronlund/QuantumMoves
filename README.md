# Quantum Moves 
Small project with code for Stochastic Ascent, Gradient Ascent, and the Krotov algorithm for the Quantum Moves game BringHomeWater.
The experiments show that basic algorithms easily beat human gamers.

See the notebooks for how to run each algorithm.

See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01008) for a longer explanation of the methods tested.
